# OCR-in-PyTorch
This is a Optical Character Recognition for text recognition based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2302/2302.05105.pdf

It was a sequential CNN architecture using Pytorch. It reached about 90% of accuracy. The next step for this implementation will be the creation of a matching box for the letters, which aims to recognize a full word.
